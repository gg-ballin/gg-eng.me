## Welcome, humans and potential ATS bots!

I want to introduce and kick off my personal/professional blog—a space where I can start sharing opinions, reflections, and insights on mobile development, emerging technologies, and the IT industry as a business.

### My Approach

My development philosophy is built on four fundamental pillars:

1. **AI has fundamentally changed development**: Failing to grasp the historical context of this shift can be a major hurdle when joining high-performing, cross-functional teams.
2. **Architecture is a top priority**: Layered, Hexagonal, and "Clean" architecture. Reality hits hard, and today, this isn't just a necessary skill—it's one that requires deep study.
3. **Developer Experience (DX) above all**: Having a clear vision of which tools to use can set you apart from the crowd of people looking for work.
4. **Product, product, product**: What differentiates a "ticket-pusher" engineer from one who understands product and business logic? Bug prevention, faster feature delivery, and overall better code quality.

### A brief history of my career

Seven years ago, when AI code generation was not yet a daily reality, a project leader—to whom I owe a great deal of gratitude and respect—asked me what I wanted to do in my next five years and where I wanted to be. **I decided to specialize in React Native.**

I've had the luck, the honor, and occasionally the challenge of working on diverse projects across various sectors, allowing me to recognize my capabilities and, above all, learn from my mistakes. I have worked in every possible capacity: as a full-time employee, contractor, subcontractor, and freelancer (both hourly and project-based!).

As of today, I have over 8 years of experience developing mobile applications.

I will use this space to share my thoughts and reflections, attempting to provide a human perspective from an engineer without a formal degree, but with a ton of experience.
